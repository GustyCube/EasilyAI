```

### Temperature and Creativity Control

```python
from easilyai import create_app

app = create_app("TemperatureTest", "anthropic", "your-key", "claude-3-sonnet-20240229")

# Low temperature for factual, consistent responses
factual_response = app.request(
    "Explain the process of photosynthesis",
    temperature=0.1
)

# Medium temperature for balanced responses
balanced_response = app.request(
    "Write a product description for a smart watch",
    temperature=0.5
)

# Higher temperature for creative responses
creative_response = app.request(
    "Write a creative short story about time travel",
    temperature=0.8
)
```

## Error Handling

### Common Claude Errors

```python
from easilyai import create_app
from easilyai.exceptions import EasilyAIException

app = create_app("Claude", "anthropic", "your-key", "claude-3-haiku-20240307")

try:
    response = app.request("Your prompt here")
    print(response)
except EasilyAIException as e:
    error_msg = str(e).lower()
    
    if "authentication" in error_msg:
        print("Authentication failed. Check your Anthropic API key.")
    elif "rate limit" in error_msg:
        print("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before making more requests.")
    elif "content" in error_msg:
        print("Content was flagged. Try rephrasing your prompt.")
    else:
        print(f"Claude API error: {e}")
```

### Handling Long Responses

```python
from easilyai import create_app

app = create_app("Claude", "anthropic", "your-key", "claude-3-opus-20240229")

# For very long content, you might need to chunk it
def get_long_response(prompt, max_tokens=4000):
    try:
        response = app.request(prompt, max_tokens=max_tokens)
        return response
    except EasilyAIException as e:
        if "token" in str(e).lower():
            # If response is too long, try with fewer tokens
            return app.request(prompt, max_tokens=max_tokens//2)
        else:
            raise e
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

```python
# Vague
vague_prompt = "Tell me about AI"

# Specific
specific_prompt = "Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning, with examples of each"
```

### 2. Use System Messages

```python
response = app.request(
    "How do I fix this code bug?",
    system="You are a helpful programming mentor. Always explain your reasoning and suggest best practices."
)
```

### 3. Structure Complex Requests

```python
structured_request = """
Please help me with the following:

Context: I'm building a web application for a small business
Task: Design a database schema for inventory management
Requirements:
- Track products, categories, suppliers
- Handle stock levels and transactions
- Support multiple locations
