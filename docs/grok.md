## Optimization Tips

### Conversational Prompting

Grok responds well to conversational prompts:

```python
from easilyai import create_app

app = create_app("GrokConversational", "grok", "your-key", "grok-beta")

# Natural conversation style
natural_response = app.request(
    "Hey, I'm curious about something. I've been hearing a lot about quantum computing lately. "
    "Can you break down what it actually means and why people are excited about it?"
)

# Direct and friendly
friendly_response = app.request(
    "I need some advice. I'm trying to improve my productivity but I keep getting distracted. "
    "What strategies have you seen work well for people?"
)
```

### Current Context Requests

Take advantage of Grok's current information:

```python
# Time-sensitive queries
current_query = app.request(
    "What's the current state of AI regulation discussions in the US and EU?"
)

# Recent developments
recent_developments = app.request(
    "What have been the most significant breakthroughs in renewable energy this year?"
)
```

### Temperature Control

```python
# For factual information
factual_response = app.request(
    "Explain the current inflation rate and its causes",
    temperature=0.3  # More focused
)

# For creative tasks
creative_response = app.request(
    "Write a creative story about time travel",
    temperature=0.8  # More creative
)
```

## Error Handling

### Common Grok Errors

```python
from easilyai import create_app
from easilyai.exceptions import EasilyAIException

app = create_app("Grok", "grok", "your-key", "grok-beta")

try:
    response = app.request("Your prompt here")
    print(response)
except EasilyAIException as e:
    error_msg = str(e).lower()
    
    if "authentication" in error_msg:
        print("Authentication failed. Check your Grok API key.")
    elif "rate limit" in error_msg:
        print("Rate limit exceeded. Please wait before making more requests.")
    elif "quota" in error_msg:
        print("API quota exceeded. Check your usage limits.")
    else:
        print(f"Grok API error: {e}")
```

### Handling Rate Limits

```python
import time
from easilyai import create_app

def grok_request_with_retry(prompt, max_retries=3):
    app = create_app("Grok", "grok", "your-key", "grok-beta")
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return app.request(prompt)
        except EasilyAIException as e:
            if "rate limit" in str(e).lower() and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
                time.sleep(wait_time)
                continue
            else:
                raise e
    
    return None
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Real-time Information

```python
# Good: Ask about current events
current_prompt = "What are the latest developments in AI regulation?"

# Less optimal: Ask about historical facts that don't require current data
historical_prompt = "When was the telephone invented?"
```

### 2. Use Conversational Style

```python
# Good: Natural conversation
conversational_prompt = "I'm trying to understand blockchain. Can you walk me through it like you're explaining to a friend?"

# Less optimal: Formal instruction
formal_prompt = "Provide a comprehensive technical overview of blockchain technology."
```

### 3. Ask Follow-up Questions

```python
# Start broad
initial_question = app.request("What should I know about starting a business?")

# Then get specific
specific_question = app.request("I'm particularly interested in the legal aspects. What are the must-know legal requirements?")
```

### 4. Be Specific About Context

```python
# Include relevant context
contextual_prompt = "I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience considering a career change to data science. What should I consider?"

# Rather than generic
generic_prompt = "Should I change careers?"
```

## Use Case Examples

### Business Consulting

```python
from easilyai import create_app

business_advisor = create_app("GrokBusiness", "grok", "your-key", "grok-beta")

# Market entry strategy
market_strategy = business_advisor.request(
    "Our B2B software company wants to expand to the European market. "
    "What are the key considerations for this expansion?"
)

# Competitive analysis
competitive_analysis = business_advisor.request(
    "Can you help me understand the competitive landscape for project management tools? "
    "What differentiates the successful players?"
)
```

### Technology Advice

```python
from easilyai import create_app

tech_advisor = create_app("GrokTech", "grok", "your-key", "grok-beta")

# Architecture decisions

    "I'm building a real-time chat application that needs to scale to millions of users. "
    "What technology stack and architecture would you recommend?"
)

# Technology trends
trend_analysis = tech_advisor.request(
    "What emerging technologies should a CTO be paying attention to in 2024?"
)
```

### Personal Development
